  <p>The <em>k</em> units active in a kWTA function are the units receiving the most excitatory input.  First the units must be sorted according to their.</p>

  <p>Then the inhibitory conductance is computed so that the top k units will have membrane potentials that are above the desired threshold, while the rest remain below the threshold.</p>

  <p>In order to implement the kWTA network we need to compute the amount of inhibitory current required to put a unit at the threshold give its current level of excitatory input; where theta is the threshold membrane potential value.</p>

  <p>For the kWTA algorithm the inhibitory conductance is computed as a value intermediate between the excitatory input values for the k and k + 1<em>th</em> units, after they have been sorted by level of excitatory conductance.  This ensures that the k+ 1th unit remains below the desired threshold value, while the k<em>th</em> unit is above it.</p>
