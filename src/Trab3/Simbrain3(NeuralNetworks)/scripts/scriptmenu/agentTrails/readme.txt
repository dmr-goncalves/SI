The main script is in agentTrails.bsh.  Comments there describe the simulation and it can be tweaked mainly there.

To run the script run Simbrain, go to Scripts > Edit/Run Scipt, navigate to the agentTrails folder, and open the agentTrails.bsh script, and press the "Runs Script" button (the play button at the top of the script editor).
