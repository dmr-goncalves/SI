SIMBRAIN 3

This is a special "early look" pre-release of Simbrain 3.0 (a major refactoring and revision, with hundreds of new features). Virtually all features in this copy of Simbrain will be present in the final version. In its current stage the documentation is incomplete, so if you have any questions please don't hesitate to post them on the forum. Also, although we have worked very hard to deliver a bug-free product, this pre-release has not undergone extensive user testing. If you encounter bugs please post a description and how to replicate the error here: https://code.google.com/p/simbrain/issues/list. 

RUNNING SIMBRAIN

To run double click Simbrain.jar.   

(Linux users: This does not work on all distributions of linux.  An alternative is to open a terminal, navigate to where Simbrain.jar is located, and then enter the command "java -jar Simbrain.jar").
